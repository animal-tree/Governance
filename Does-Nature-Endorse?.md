# Synchronicities in Presidential Elections

## Examples of a Plausible Universe-Endorsement

- Such as the bird that [landed on Bernie's podium](https://youtu.be/QAYAih_eE0o?si=NnVzQrETjngJCz6J), early 2016.
- Such as the Bald Eagle (America's national bird) that [attacked Donald Trump](https://youtu.be/j1AU4qi7tWg?si=ItrWUDXTbLLN7Yw), 3.5 months before that.
- Such as Hillary Clinton being nominated over Bernie in 2016 and us being punished with a cartoon for a President for 4 years.
- Such as the [Shadow corporation blackout](https://youtu.be/9ljkWdXTx10?si=LXd_fXCDwyzQw2-i) when Pete Buttigieg barely [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnM870CCu8) above Bernie in the Iowa delegate vote (and [not the popular vote](https://youtu.be/swJW-bVc2es?si=pNYINRyCP4Yq0qu1)), February 3, 2020.
  - Specifically, the voting app that was used in Iowa, the first state to vote in the primaries, where polls [projected Bernie was going to win](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/iowa/), had [“bad code,"](https://youtu.be/A7WzQRXwxos?si=tjnnnbyCtalch4g8) and was built by a company literally called Shadow [with financial ties to Pete Buttigieg's campaign](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2609701/buttigieg-campaign-paid-firm-that-developed-voting-app-blamed-for-iowa-caucus-delays/). Ultimately, it was reported that Pete Buttigieg just barely won the delegate vote and Bernie Sanders won the popular vote. In my opinion, this was not orchestrated by Pete Buttigieg's campaign or the Democratic party (that would be too on the nose) and is therefore a synchronicity, or "statistically implausible coincidence."
- Such as the fact that it was [statistically unprecedented](https://youtu.be/SknqmOfXDSI?si=67VTmYjfVix-xepM) for somebody to win the popular vote in Iowa, New Hampshire, [*and Nevada*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-biden-sanders-116719), as Bernie did, and not become the party nominee.
- Such as Biden's [first comeback victory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary) over Bernie, and Biden's [first victory in a presidential primary ever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary), marking the exact day (February 29, 2020) of the [first American to die from Covid according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=February%2029%2C%202020&text=CDC%20and%20the%20Washington%20Department,later%20died%20of%20his%20illness.). ["Biden celebrates a comeback victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary, just as the U.S. reports what was believed to be the country’s first death from the coronavirus."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/pandemic-campaign-trump-biden/) - Washington Post. And while that wasn't the turning point for Biden's campaign yet, he did announce, ["We are very much alive"](https://youtu.be/UNqwH_3Hyds?si=A-oa2X_2TQSD4AiZ) at the onset of the first American plague.
- Such as the fact that every competetive candidate except Elizabeth Warren dropped out overnight last-minute and gave Biden the crucial victory [on Super Tuesday](https://youtu.be/K_NT-ViVR40?si=0U4AS3OEdpH9dIVe&t=257), March 3, 2020.
  - Right up until that last-second collusion[^1], Bernie was ahead [in every national poll](https://youtu.be/DHatG_lSI2U?si=1BztfIsqPxDunZHx) and [the betting markets](https://youtu.be/iqtxkVS17to?si=ZY6Bqs4Vq-xNWGQT), by wide margins, and [of course on policy preferance as well](https://youtu.be/5MhaqVLoqHI?si=lUE0pH3FuUKViiWe), and [even in some of the expectations of the media](https://youtu.be/cohYnKrZ94U?si=QCRcKM4Z9f4fRLwg) ([even CNN](https://youtu.be/5AD3jKGlLjw?si=_nYcCDviPOuv08DD)).
  - ["Joe Biden just pulled off the biggest, fastest and most unexpected comeback in modern political history."](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/joe-biden-super-tuesday-historic-comeback/index.html) - CNN. "There was simply no reason to think any of this was possible."
  - Each of the competetive candidates dropped out, except Elizabeth Warren, who stayed in. [70%](https://qr.ae/pszN6o) of the votes Elizabeth Warren (whose ideology is at least 70% closer to Bernie's than Biden's) received on Super Tuesday [would've been enough to give Bernie Sanders the Super Tuesday victory](https://medium.com/@damonjimmyhorn/what-if-elizabeth-warren-dropped-out-before-super-tuesday-a3a7769eee10) (and the California delegates also [ended up](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811814642/sanders-wins-california-largest-super-tuesday-prize-fueled-by-latino-vote) going to Bernie, meaning [no more than 66%](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811814642/sanders-wins-california-largest-super-tuesday-prize-fueled-by-latino-vote) of her voters were needed to turn out for Bernie actually) and, [while an ideology-based transfer of votes wasn’t gaurenteed](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/no-warren-didnt-rob-bernie-of-the-nomination.html), that principled outcome would've most likely secured him the Democratic nomination (conclusively and irreversibly in all likelihood, and then I think he [would've defeated Trump as well](https://youtu.be/7yMGyOU4yLI?si=xpD_TzHzk80FNvnp&t=58)).
- Such as a literal plague thereafter killing more Americans than the American Revolution, Civil War, and WWII (including Pearl Harbor) combined[^2]. 
  - But [at least we got Biden](https://youtu.be/BhvdaK_HgbQ?si=yZ3obsrd423oIe61), and even while Trump was still sitting his final days in office in 2020 ([March 27, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act#:~:text=The%20Coronavirus%20Aid%2C%20Relief%2C%20and,pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20States.) - January 20, 2021), the president's hand was forced to pass many far-left policies, which continued with Biden as well:
    - Rapid [mass distribution of free medicine](https://youtu.be/T51a_7ljXnU?si=X0zRReRgZPKwkp4f).
    - [Giving everybody free money without means-testing](https://youtu.be/3869NqO8MUw?si=Hw-9jW-4wTxFSdCJ).
    - Adaptive labor conditions and stay-at-home working (just in time for the major advancements in automation that were discussed for the first time on a presidential primary debate pulpit [via Andrew Yang that election cycle](https://youtu.be/XbrDu8uWXCI?si=KcnZlTLXLHI4SERS)).
    - Thousands of poor Americans got bigger paychecks from the government than they'd ever seen in their lives (a kind of universal basic income happened under both Trump and Biden, [also proposed on that Democratic stage](https://youtu.be/j-pJzQJJiUs?si=rbCl_kUZdZSxuivk)).
    - Student debt repayment moratoria and [cancellation](https://www.youtube.com/live/k2steBZ1JyE?si=v-YdO9nD8C3sGaOn), though [not to the extent that Bernie calls for](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/), that the Supreme Court surprisingly overturned [beyond the Supreme Court's authority](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/justice-kagan-calls-student-loan-decision-overreach-blows-constitution-rcna92044) (at least going by ["a strict textual interpretation of the law"](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/will-the-supreme-court-overturn-student-debt-relief-forgiveness-cancellation-biden.html)).
    - Defining what "essential work" means, before the recent advances in AI and robotics, regarding which, Bernie is still (in 2024) acting like the most presidential leader of the 2020 frontrunners (despite *potentially* having no real political incentive to do so), [championing the 32-hour work week](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf) even now, which could (or rather, [by all reason should](https://youtu.be/PjJexW556Bw?si=ZgJwL2RG9m2BgEt6)) plausibly pass by *2032* (the 40-hour work week passed [in 1940](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf)).
    - Not to mention [a large reduction in carbon pollution](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/emission-reductions-from-pandemic-had-unexpected-effects-on-atmosphere) [due to the pandemic, especially from automobile traffic and industry](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/1.GCP_.pdf), and Bernie's recent [Solar for All bill that passed](https://youtu.be/8hi-JpwoLi4?si=plTrjIPQ1Iuk_-SO).
- Such as the beyond ["unprecedentedness" of Bernie Sanders](https://qr.ae/psqdok) overall, including that he's a Jewish Democratic Socialist whose been entirely people-funded his entire life, [staggeringly breaking all records](https://youtu.be/akYmB9ZX8ps?si=11YIwObmXBxvtTU_), and at the time considered by the media as [too old](https://youtu.be/1RXSYhGJ9yw?si=qu6jWB_DaL-Y6Tal) (a criticism that should never be made of him again) when he was 77 in the 2020 campaign.
  - But distinct from Donald Trump, because Nature asks us to vote morally, not according to magic synchronicities. Nature also uses the latter to make fun of us and create farces, such as, for example, our current leading representatives in the running for the presidency in 2024 are [an 81 year-old man undergoing cognitive decline](https://youtu.be/CAyBNzxxj2E?si=MnB8yjb889MRAUet) and [a 78 year-old charged felon](https://youtu.be/fSNMSTkeLcA?si=EMGGOK3IO7-GE15D). Hindsight this time around really is 2020. But that is something to say about Donald Trump: He obeyed some laws of consciousness-physics more than other politicians and that gave Republicans their own image-apparent to Bernie Sanders. Perhaps the shared timing of two populist figures rising on both the left and the right had to do with more than just some of the shared-underlying-ordinary-causal-factors [that explain Bernie's rise](https://youtu.be/Gk_gWWar7hs?si=s66d-m7ERSQ89nqq) [and some of Trump's rise, and the scapegoating that explains Trump's rise](https://youtu.be/Gk_gWWar7hs?si=s66d-m7ERSQ89nqq), but also perhaps something not-causal-by-modern-physics-and/or-consciousness-knowledge.
    - It perhaps also highlights the poetic but distinguishing symmetry between the two populists that ["Medicare for All"](https://youtu.be/OrQXhYcYKHc?si=Z_Rh0j8nao5fL5o7) and ["Build a wall,"](https://youtu.be/Iuc5bTfAY6U?si=S986vdZn2hVS8OWH) the policy cornerstones of each respectively, linguistically rhyme. The fact that the cornerstone of Bernie's platform just before the plague was about universal healthcare, is also synchronistic.
  - The Great Depression lasted from 3 terms of bad Republican leadership (Harding, Republican, 1921 - 1923; Coolidge, Republican, 1923 - 1929; Hoover, Republican, 1929 - 1933), due to wealth inequality, corruption, Wall Street, banks, and [a mass redistribution of wealth to the top 1%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-been-almost-a-100-years-since-the-americas-1-had-so-much-wealth-2019-02-11). Those 3 terms were the Great Depression, followed by alleviation when Franklin D. Roosevelt took into office (for a little under 4 terms, ending by his death). These 3 terms, 2016-2028 (perhaps truncated), are the Great Political Farce, and I think 2028 - at least 2032, should be the term(s) of President Bernie Sanders, when Bernie Sanders takes into office. And perhaps he can have ~4 terms.
    - Bernie was born a year before Biden, both were born during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 3rd term, though Bernie is several decades younger in cognitive health.


Okay that’s all. 

## Meaning

No wait:

I think Nature’s meaning changes from symbol to symbol, depending on what the goal and conveyed message is. There are no strict rules “this means good”, “this means bad.” Nature achieves what Nature intends (with a big footnote answering [perhaps why suffering happens](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Cosmogenesis-Myth-2.md)). But interpreting that message requires intelligence and wisdom.

For example, I’m someone who once had a traumatic experience involving bugs. Don’t call me bug-man, but I vowed at the end of it “Every living thing” for who I serve (or at least that’s what I meant when I was tripping on mushrooms — don’t hold me to anything).

Anyway, if a bug appeared in my apartment, I would interpret it as Nature saying, I just debugged something. 

Or I might interpret it as someone who sees bugs and thinks they’re terrible omens. It differs. It depends on what I want and what makes sense. 

## Political Manipulation via Manufactured Signs

But like, one more thing: 

In the process of explaining them, my mind sort of has found too many patterns, especially in language, for comfort, sometimes! So pattern discernment is pretty important at the risk of going insane or, “exploited” is a relevant word. With coincidences if people really read into signs, their voting opinions and stuff like that could be manipulated by bad actors.

Be wary, because when this nature of the universe is proved, politicians will exploit it.

They \*might\*, I should say — they plausibly might use manufactured “signs” to sway voters. Manufactured synchronicity for manipulation.

In order to emulate/synthesize Nature's Word.

This can only come from humans, I think.
