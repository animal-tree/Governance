# Synchronicities in Presidential Elections

## Examples of a Plausible Universe-Endorsement

- Such as the bird that [landed on Bernie's podium](https://youtu.be/QAYAih_eE0o?si=NnVzQrETjngJCz6J).
- Such as the Bald Eagle (America's national bird) [attacking Donald Trump](https://youtu.be/j1AU4qi7tWg?si=ItrWUDXTbLLN7Yw).
- Such as Hillary Clinton being nominated and us being punished with a cartoon for a President for 4 years.
- Such as the [Shadow corporation blackout](https://youtu.be/A7WzQRXwxos?si=tjnnnbyCtalch4g8) when Pete Buttigieg barely [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnM870CCu8) above Bernie in the Iowa delegate vote (and [not the popular vote](https://youtu.be/swJW-bVc2es?si=pNYINRyCP4Yq0qu1)).
- Such as the fact that it was [statistically unprecedented](https://youtu.be/SknqmOfXDSI?si=67VTmYjfVix-xepM) for somebody to win the popular vote in Iowa, New Hampshire, [*and Nevada*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-biden-sanders-116719) and not become the Democratic nominee.
- Such as the fact that every competetive candidate except Elizabeth Warren dropped out overnight last-minute and gave Biden the crucial victory [on Super Tuesday](https://youtu.be/K_NT-ViVR40?si=0U4AS3OEdpH9dIVe&t=257).
- Such as the fact that mail-in voting increased above 40% (above the 50% mark) for [quarantine only right after that Super Tuesday](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/10/13/mail-in-voting-became-much-more-common-in-2020-primaries-as-covid-19-spread/ft_20-09-29_absenteevoting_2-png/), followed by a literal plague killing more Americans than the American Revolution, Civil War, and WWII (including Pearl Harbor) combined[^1], though not nearly as many as the Great Depression.
- Such as the beyond ["unprecedentedness" of Bernie Sanders](https://qr.ae/psqdok) overall.
  - But distinct from Donald Trump, because Nature asks us to vote morally, not according to magic synchronicities. Nature also uses the latter to make fun of us and create farces, such as, for example, our current leading representatives in the running for the Presidency in 2024 are [an 81 year-old man undergoing cognitive decline](https://youtu.be/CAyBNzxxj2E?si=MnB8yjb889MRAUet) and [a 78 year-old charged felon](https://youtu.be/fSNMSTkeLcA?si=EMGGOK3IO7-GE15D). But that is something to say about Donald Trump: He obeyed some laws of physics more than other politicians and that gave Republicans their own image-apparent to Bernie Sanders.

Okay that’s all. 

## Meaning

No wait:

I think Nature’s meaning changes from symbol to symbol, depending on what the goal and conveyed message is. There are no strict rules “this means good”, “this means bad.” Nature achieves what Nature intends (with a big footnote answering [perhaps why suffering happens](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Cosmogenesis-Myth-2.md)). But interpreting that message requires intelligence and wisdom.

For example, I’m someone who once had a traumatic experience involving bugs. Don’t call me bug-man, but I vowed at the end of it “Every living thing” for who I serve (or at least that’s what I meant when I was tripping on acid — don’t hold me to anything).

Anyway, if a bug appeared in my apartment, I would interpret it as Nature saying, I just debugged something. 

Or I might interpret it as someone who sees bugs and thinks they’re terrible omens. It differs. It depends on what I want and what makes sense. 

## Political Manipulation via Manufactured Signs

But like, one more thing: 

In the process of explaining them, my mind sort of has found too many patterns, especially in language, for comfort, sometimes! So pattern discernment is pretty important at the risk of going insane or, “exploited” is a relevant word. With coincidences if people really read into signs, their voting opinions and stuff like that could be manipulated by bad actors.

Be wary, because when this nature of the universe is proved, politicians will exploit it.

They \*might\*, I should say — they plausibly might use manufactured “signs” to sway voters. Manufactured synchronicity for manipulation.

In order to emulate/synthesize Nature's Word.

This can only come from humans, I think.
